          <h2>Jhansi ki Rani</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Rani Lakshmibai</b> (19 November 1828 – 18 June
            1858) was known for her outstanding bravery who was an important 
            name in the Freedom Struggle against the British. She was
            named Manikarnika Tambe and was nicknamed Manu.  Her father was
            Moropant Tambe and her mother Bhagirathi Sapre (Bhagirathi 
            Bai) who hailed from modern day Maharashtra. She was 
            educated at home, able to read and write, and was more 
            independent in her childhood than others of her age; her studies
            included shooting, horsemanship, fencing which was in contrast
            to the cultural expectations for women in Indian society at the
            time. At the age of 14, she was married to the Maharaja of 
            Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao in 1842. After her marriage, she was called
            Laxmibai. Her son Damodar Rao was born in 1851. But he died after
            four months. Gangadhar Rao died in 1853.

            <li>
              Lord Dalhousie (Born on April 22, 1812) sought to annex Jhansi when the Maharaja died applying the 
              Doctrine of Lapse since the king did not have any natural heir.
            </li>
            <li>
              As per this, the Rani was granted an annual pension and asked to leave the fort of Jhansi.
